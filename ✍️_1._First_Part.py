    Jimmy‚Äôs father worked for OrganInc Farms. He was a genographer, one of the best in the field. He‚Äôd done some of the key studies on mapping the proteonome when he was still a post-grad, and then he‚Äôd helped engineer the Methuselah Mouse as part of Operation Immortality. After that, at OrganInc Farms, he‚Äôd been one of the foremost architects of the pigoon project, along with a team of transplant experts and the microbiologists who were splicing against infections. Pigoon was only a nickname: the official name was sus multiorganifer. But pigoon was what everyone said. Sometimes they said Organ-Oink Farms, but not as often. It wasn‚Äôt really a farm anyway, not like the farms in pictures.
    The goal of the pigoon project was to grow an assortment of foolproof human- tissue organs in a transgenic knockout pig host ‚Äì organs that would transplant smoothly and avoid rejection, but would also be able to fend off attacks by opportunistic microbes and viruses, of which there were more strains every year. A rapid-maturity gene was spliced in so the pigoon kidneys and livers and hearts would be ready sooner, and now they were perfecting a pigoon that could grow five or six kidneys at a time. Such a host animal could be reaped of its extra kidneys; then, rather than being destroyed, it could keep on living and grow more organs, much as a lobster could grow another claw to replace a missing one. That would be less wasteful, as it took a lot of food and care to grow a pigoon. A great deal of investment money had gone into OrganInc Farms.
    All of this was explained to Jimmy when he was old enough.
    Old enough, Snowman thinks as he scratches himself, around but not on top of the insect bites. Such a dumb concept. Old enough for what? To drink, to fuck, to know better? What fathead was in charge of making those decisions? For example, Snowman himself isn‚Äôt old enough for this, this ‚Äì what can it be called? This situation. He‚Äôll never be old enough, no sane human being could ever . . .
    Each one of us must tread the path laid out before him, or her, says the voice in his head, a man‚Äôs this time, the style bogus guru, and each path is unique. It is not the nature of the path itself that should concern the seeker, but the grace and strength and patience with which each and every one of us follows the sometimes challenging . . .
    ‚ÄúStuff it,‚Äù says Snowman. Some cheap do-it-yourself enlightenment handbook, Nirvana for halfwits. Though he has the nagging feeling that he may well have written this gem himself.
    In happier days, naturally. Oh, so much happier.
